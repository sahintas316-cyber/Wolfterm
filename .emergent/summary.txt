The AI engineer successfully completed a comprehensive set of tasks, evolving a simple React/FastAPI/MongoDB template into a full-fledged e-commerce marketing site. Initially, the core task was to create a pixel-perfect clone of , which involved detailed frontend replication, multi-language support, and integration with a new FastAPI backend for product and review management. Following this, the user requested an administrative panel, leading to the implementation of robust authentication and full CRUD functionalities for site content, including hero slides and site settings. A mid-project rebranding to WolfTerm was also seamlessly integrated across both frontend and backend. The latest interaction involved assisting the user with deployment options, preparing deployable artifacts, and providing detailed guides for various hosting environments. The process demonstrates a strong adherence to product requirements and a structured development workflow.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of , replicating its design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and structure across devices, including all interactive elements and page transitions. This involved implementing a hero slider, product catalog with categories and detail pages, a reviews section, an about page, and search functionality with multi-language support (RU, EN, IT, TR). Subsequently, the user asked for a comprehensive admin panel capable of managing all website content, including products, categories, reviews, hero slides, and general site settings (images, texts). A mid-project requirement was to rebrand the entire application to WolfTerm, changing logos and names while preserving the existing structure. Finally, the user requested assistance in deploying the website, specifically for their own Plesk hosting and, failing direct push, a temporary public deployment for testing.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved assisting the user with deploying the completed WolfTerm website, which now includes a comprehensive admin panel. After implementing all requested features (pixel-perfect clone, multi-language, full admin panel, and rebranding), the user asked for deployment assistance. The AI engineer has prepared the application for deployment by creating deployable zip archives for both the frontend () and backend (). Detailed instructions have been provided for temporary public deployment using Netlify Drop for the frontend and Railway for the backend. This directly addresses the user's request to publish this website, I will make corrections there, then we will publish it on our real hosting. The current state is that the deployment packages are ready, and the instructions have been provided to the user for them to initiate the deployment process on these platforms.
